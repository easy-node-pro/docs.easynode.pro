## What is a SERV Validator?
[SERV Protocol](https://serv.services) is a network for developers, gamers and validators, by developers, gamers and validators.

## The Easy Node Way
When using our guides or tips you can always assume the following things that aren't really specified in the SERV Documents. We call this "The Easy Node Way" which helps with organization and security:

-  Setup a user account to run the servnode software
  -  Don't use `root` or `serv` as account names!
  -  We suggest your username as something like `servuser`

## Validator Support Communities
There is no setup help or support officially provided to validators by the blockchains you are your own help desk. It's always best to fully learn your system before going live on a blockchain. If you do get stuck you can always ask for help in:
- [SERV VDAO Discord](https://discord.gg/w9mU7mpYVz) is the best spot for all things SERV Validators first for fastest response.
- [SERV Discord](https://discord.gg/ejhk24nKK2) is the main SERV Protocol discord server.
- [SERV Twitter](https://twitter.com/servprotocol) account.
