# ENP Token White Paper

Whitepaper Version 1.1.0 - January 21, 2025

## Introduction

The ENP token is a utility token designed to incentivize and reward users for staking with our [EasyNode.pro](https://staking.harmony.one/validators/mainnet/one18julyys26h67r4vq3zexzpfmvt9vpn0g75phmu) & [RockTheBlockchain](https://staking.harmony.one/validators/mainnet/one1p2rmvndevvw682qynqu08hyvx24hh4runsw6pz) validator pools on the Harmony blockchain. By providing a unique token-based reward system, we aim to create a more engaging and profitable experience for our users while also promoting the growth and adoption of the Harmony ecosystem.

## Token Overview

- **Token Name:** ENP (EasyNode.pro)
- **Token Symbol:** ENP
- **Total Supply:** 500,000,000 ENP
- **Token Type:** ERC-20
- **Blockchain:** Harmony

## Token Distribution

The ENP token has been distributed as follows:

- **Airdrops:** 30% of the total supply (150,000,000 ENP) will be airdropped to users who stake with our EasyNode.pro & RockTheBlockchain validator pools, proportional to their stake weight.
- **Liquidity Pool:** 15% of the total supply (75,000,000 ENP) is allocated to a liquidity pools on a decentralized exchange (DEX), paired with Harmony's ONE, uONE, and MONA on Harmony Protocol.
- **Team Allocation:** 5% of the total supply (25,000,000 ENP) is allocated to the team as hot tokens to help keep ENP active and engaged.
- **Remaining Tokens:** 50% of the total supply (250,000,000 ENP) is reserved for future development, partnerships, and other purposes.

## Token Utility

The ENP token will have the following utilities:

- **Staking Rewards:** ENP tokens will be distributed as rewards to users who stake with our validator pools EasyNode.pro & RockTheBlockchain, in addition to the standard ONE rewards.
- **Liquidity Provision:** ENP tokens were used to provide liquidity on [swap.harmony.one DEX](swap.harmony.one), paired with ONE, uONE, and MONA to create a stable and liquid market.
- **Token Burning:** A portion of the ENP tokens will be burned periodically, using the ONE rewards earned by our validator pool, to reduce the total supply and increase the token's value.
- **Governance:** ENP token holders will have voting rights on proposals for the development and growth of our validator pool and the Harmony ecosystem.

## Tokenomics

The ENP token's value will be driven by the following factors:

- **Staking Demand:** The demand for ENP tokens will increase as more users stake with our validator pool, driving up the token's value.
- **Liquidity:** The liquidity pool will provide a stable source of buy and sell pressure, maintaining a stable market price.
- **Token Burning:** The periodic burning of ENP tokens will reduce the total supply, increasing the token's value over time.
- **Adoption:** As the Harmony ecosystem grows, the demand for ENP tokens will increase, driving up the token's value.

## Validator Pool Integration

Our validator pools, EasyNode.pro & RockTheBlockchain, will be integrated with the ENP token as follows:

- **Staking Rewards:** Users who stake with our validator pools will receive ENP tokens as rewards, in addition to the standard ONE rewards.
- **Weighted Distribution:** ENP tokens will be distributed to users based on their stake weight, ensuring that larger stakeholders receive a proportionally larger share of the rewards.
- **Reward Schedule:** ENP tokens will be distributed on a regular schedule, ensuring that users receive their rewards in a timely and predictable manner.

## Liquidity Pool Strategy

Our liquidity pool strategy will involve the following:

- **Initial Liquidity:** We started 2 LP funds with the following allocations:
  - 55 million ENP / 34,000 ONE
  - 20 million ENP / 1.6 billion MONA
  - Approximately 75 million ENP has been allocated to LP pools to start.
- **ONE Rewards:** We will use the ONE rewards earned by our validator pool to buy ENP tokens on the market. Those tokens will be used for LP, burned or reserved for future airdrops.

## Airdrop Strategy

### Initial Airdrop

- 10 million ENP was airdropped to EasyNode.pro Validator delegators.
- 20 million ENP was airdropped to RockTheBlockchain Validator delegators.
- 2 million ENP was airdropped to each of the following validator delegators: Farmony, Harmony Hub, and Deadpool.

### Future Airdrops

- Future airdrops will only go to EasyNode.pro and RockTheBlockchain delegators. Users are encouraged to migrate to these validators to receive future airdrops.
- A total of 36 million ENP has been airdropped so far
- A total of 69 million ENP will be airdropped over the next 23 months, through December 2026
- Airdrop plans post 2026 will be updated here when determined, TBD.
- At least 45 million ENP will remain after the scheduled airdrops, future usage TBD.
- Tokens we buy with validator rewards may be added to the next monthly airdrop or burned, TBD.
