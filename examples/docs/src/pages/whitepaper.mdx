# ENP Token White Paper

By providing a unique token-based reward system, we aim to create a more engaging and profitable experience for our users while promoting the growth and adoption of the Harmony ecosystem.

## Token Utility

The ENP token has the following utilities:

- **Staking Rewards:** ENP tokens will be distributed as rewards to users who stake with our validator pools EasyNode.pro & RockTheBlockchain, in addition to the standard ONE rewards.
- **Liquidity Provision:** ENP tokens were used to provide liquidity on [swap.harmony.one DEX](swap.harmony.one), paired with ONE, USDC and MONA to create a stable and liquid market.
- **Token Burning:** A portion of the ENP tokens will be burned periodically using the ONE rewards earned by our validator pool, to reduce the total supply and increase the token's value.
- **Governance:** ENP token holders will have voting rights on proposals for the development and growth of our validator pool and the Harmony ecosystem.

## Tokenomics

The ENP token's value will be driven by the following factors:

- **Validator Rewards:** We will use a % of our monthly rewards to buy, burn, hold, grow LP, and more with `$ENP` & paired coins.
- **Staking Demand:** The demand for ENP tokens will increase as more users stake with our validator pool, driving up the token's value.
- **Liquidity:** The liquidity pool will provide a stable source of buy and sell pressure, maintaining a stable market price.
- **Token Burning:** The periodic burning of ENP tokens will reduce the total supply, increasing the token's value over time.
- **Adoption:** As the Harmony ecosystem grows, the demand for ENP tokens will increase, driving up the token's value.

## Validator Pool Integration

Our validator pools, EasyNode.pro & RockTheBlockchain, will be integrated with the ENP token as follows:

- **Staking Rewards:** Users who stake with our validator pools will receive ENP tokens as rewards, in addition to the standard ONE rewards.
- **Weighted Distribution:** ENP tokens will be distributed to users based on their stake weight, ensuring that larger stakeholders receive a proportionally larger share of the rewards.
- **Reward Schedule:** ENP tokens will be distributed on the first of each month through January 2027. Beyond that, schedule & allocation TBD.
